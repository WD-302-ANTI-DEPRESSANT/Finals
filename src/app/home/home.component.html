        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          We are committed to spreading knowledge about mental health issues and
          providing resources for those in need of assistance. We think that
          mental health deserves the same amount of care and attention as
          physical health since it is equally vital. Our goal is to arm people
          with trustworthy resources and knowledge so they can take charge of
          their mental health. We appreciate your support of our effort to
          advance mental health advocacy by having you visit our website.
